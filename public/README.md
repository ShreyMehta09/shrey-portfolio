# Profile Image Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Image

1. Save your profile photo as `profile.jpg` in this folder (the public directory).
2. For best results, use a square image (1:1 aspect ratio).
3. Recommended size: 500x500 pixels or larger.
4. The image will be automatically displayed in the circular frame on the homepage.

## Important Notes

- If no `profile.jpg` file is found, the website will display your initials (SM) instead.
- The image should be in JPG format for best compatibility.
- You can replace the image at any time - just make sure to keep the same filename.

## Image Optimization Tips

For faster loading and better performance:
- Compress your image before uploading (use tools like TinyJPG or ImageOptim)
- Keep the file size under 500KB if possible
- Use a professional headshot for best appearance
